Snake Game üêç

This project implements a classic Snake Game using Java and Swing. The game consists of a snake that moves around a bounded area, eating food pellets to grow longer. The player controls the direction of the snake, and the game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the game area. The project is structured into three main Java classes: GameFrame, GamePanel, and SnakeGame. GameFrame sets up the main window for the game using JFrame, while GamePanel manages the game logic and rendering on a JPanel. The SnakeGame class contains the main method to initialize the game frame and start the game loop. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts, event handling, and basic game development techniques in Java.
